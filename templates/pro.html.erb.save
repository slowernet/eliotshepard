<p>Hello. I'm a software developer, team leader, and entrepreneur who's been creating successful online products for more than twenty years.</p>

<p>I help companies define the products aligned with their strategic goals, hone their product development process, and refine the language they use to take product to market.</p>

<p>Most recently I was a VP of Product for Vox Media, who acquired the network of media brands (Curbed, Eater, Racked) where I had been a partner and CTO since its founding in 2004. I've also worked for Reuters, Sony and the Smithsonian.</p>

<p>If you're interested in working together, please <a href="mailto:eshepard@slower.net">send me an email</a>.</p>
